  Our project is a blockchain application that changes the power dynamic in prescription validation in the healthcare system. 
  Namely, it reorganizes the power hierarchy between the patient, pharmacist and physician by implementing a voter-based system 
  for pharmacists to approve prescriptions given to certain patients by certain doctors. 

  Through our systems, patients no longer have to rely on orders from specific pharmacies or pharmacists. On a large scale, patients
  can get their prescriptions approved within seconds, and through the blackbox, blockchain system, can order from any online pharmacy 
  of their choosing, supporting the rise of online, e-commerce pharmaceutical platforms.
