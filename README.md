# Decentralized Prescription Validator

## Overview
  A blockchain application that changes the power dynamic in prescription validation in the healthcare system. 
  Namely, it reorganizes the power hierarchy between the patient, pharmacist and physician by implementing a voter-based system 
  for pharmacists to approve prescriptions given to certain patients by certain doctors. Through our systems patients
   no longer have to rely on orders from specific pharmacies or pharmacists, and we aim 
  to solve the problem of prescription fraud and ensure that patients are receiving the correct medication.
  
  This decentralized prescription validator allows patients to verify the authenticity 
  of their prescriptions. This system ensures that prescriptions are not tampered and 
  uses a voting mechanism on the prescription tasks that are listed by the doctors
  and voted by the pharmacists on a blockchain - so that the data record is immutable and cannot be tampered.
